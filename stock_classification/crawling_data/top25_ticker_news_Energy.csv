XOM,Oil isn't going anywhere. Here's why.,"You can catch Trader Talk on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Amazon Music, or wherever you get your podcasts. Oil’s inherent volatility leads many investors to overreact—piling into energy stocks when prices spike and fleeing at the first sign of a drop. This short-term mindset seldom pays off because oil is influenced by countless factors, from geopolitics to production decisions and economic cycles. Despite headlines about renewables, fossil fuels remain essential for AI data centers, global manufacturing, and massive infrastructure projects. US producers also provide a stabilizing force by ramping up supply whenever prices run too high, making this a far cry from the days when OPEC alone set the tone. The takeaway? Quit treating oil (CL=F, BZ=F) like a lottery ticket. Instead, focus on companies poised to thrive through all market phases—refiners, pipeline operators, and diversified firms. By recognizing oil’s continued importance and the industry’s structural shifts, you’ll be better positioned for long-term gains over short-lived swings. Watch more episodes of Trader Talk here.

Thummel also highlights that geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran under a Trump 2.0 administration could put a further strain on oil pricing: “If you sanction Iran then and actually apply the sanctions, you're going to have a basically less oil supply because the result will be lower exports of crude oil from Iran — which basically takes supply off of the market.""

He points to names like Williams Companies (WMB), Oneok (OKE), and Targa Resources (TRGP) as examples, noting they ""still have a lot of room to run"" and will offer investors a 4 to 5% dividend yield that will only grow. He notes that Energy Transfer (ET) offers about an 8% dividend yield and predicts it to grow between 3% and 5%. He argues that these energy companies ""generate steady, consistent earnings,"" adding, ""then they convert those earnings into cash and then turn around and pay that cash back to the shareholder in the form of higher dividends and stock buybacks."" As Hurricane Francine barrels toward Louisiana, Thummel notes that 48% of US refining capacity exists on the Gulf Coast. However, the hurricane shouldn't be too much cause for concern as it appears to be moving further east. He notes that refinery operations in Baton Rouge will likely have to either shut down or reduce production temporarily, but other refineries should be able to operate as normal. ""Keep in mind, this is not the first hurricane, obviously, that these energy companies have gone through. They've done a really good job. Management teams have done a really good job of making their assets more hurricane-resistant. And so that's really benefiting all of us because we don't have to worry about these long disruptions that cause significant price hikes... during the hurricane season itself.""

The threat reflects the double-edged nature of Trump's protectionist policies, which are intended to boost U.S. business and force action to stop drug trafficking and illegal immigration, but could also inadvertently undermine his hopes of vastly expanding U.S. energy output. Trump over the weekend announced a 10% tariff on Chinese imports as part of a broad plan to improve the U.S. trade balance, triggering retaliation from Beijing which slapped a 15% tariff on U.S. LNG and coal, and a 10% tariff on U.S. oil.",Energy

LNG,Trump wants to lower oil prices. It may be harder than he thinks.,"In his speech to World Economic Forum attendees. President Trump made it clear he wants OPEC to lower oil prices. But actually getting lower prices lower may be more difficult than he made it sound. TD Cowen Managing Director Jason Gabelman explains that US policy is part of the reason for the recent rise in oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F) and that Trump may actually cause them to rise more.""Trump adds additional risk to that with strong, very hawkish views against Iran, potential to limit Venezuelan crude exports and risking additional crude that's currently being supplied to the market. So the whole notion that OPEC needs to add barrels to the market and they're the reason that oil prices are currently high seems to not factually be the case."" Trump also wants to increase oil production in the United States, but Gabelman notes that, too, may face pushback. ""US companies and energy stocks have benefited from being more rational in how much capital they deploy into the oil field and how much they drill. And the stocks have been awarded for reducing CapEx spend and returning more cash to shareholders. If they drill more oil, that's a reversal of that trend and you would expect the stocks to weaken. So I don't expect companies to start to ramp up spend in oil fields and really rapidly expand the amount of oil that they're currently producing.""

Cook says this nomination ""says a lot about the Trump administration's plans for unlocking the abundance of energy resource that we have here in the United States."" He notes that the administration views this energy abundance as ""a source of strength"" in reducing regulatory barriers in the energy sector. ""It's important to remember we continue to operate as an industry with a strong sense of capital discipline,"" he states. ""The Trump administration can strongly encourage the industry to begin drilling and grow production, but ultimately it's the companies themselves that make those decisions, and as we know, they answer to the shareholders."" Looking ahead to 2025, Cook projects crude oil (CL=F, BZ=F) prices will remain within the $70 to $80 per barrel range and expects US crude oil and natural gas (NG=F) production to increase. For investment opportunities in the energy sector, Cook recommends focusing on high-quality, large-cap companies.
