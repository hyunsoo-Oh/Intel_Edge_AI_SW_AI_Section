WELL,REITs: Welltower to benefit heavily from the 'Silver Tsunami',"In today's segment of Good Buy or Goodbye, host Julie Hyman is joined by Mizuho Americas managing director and senior analyst Vikram Malhotra to explore his top picks and potential pitfalls in the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector. Malhotra advises investors to purchase Welltower, Inc. (WELL) — an owner of senior living facilities. Malhorta notes demand continues to accelerate for these types of facilities, calling it ""the Silver Tsunami beneficiary"" over the next 5 years as the senior population grows. He notes that this growing demand with a lack of supply will create clear pricing power for the developer. Malhotra also points to promising growth and acquisition opportunities in the sector. Meanwhile, Malhorta takes a bearish outlook on Rexford Industrial (REXR) — an owner of manufacturing and distribution facilities. He expresses concerns about the company's Southern California market focus, citing challenging supply and demand dynamics. Malhorta also goes on to point out that the potential for redevelopment lease-up is slowing, which could negatively impact both revenue and profitability. Furthermore, Malhotra sees minimal pricing power in the region, making Rexford Industrial a less attractive investment. Catch more of Yahoo Finance's Good Buy or Goodbye by clicking here.

EQR,This REIT will benefit long-term from Fed rate cuts,"September's Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index and October's jobs report are on the horizon for this week, with the Federal Reserve and investors anticipating what fresh economic data could mean for interest rates. Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to share her perspective on current market dynamics as new inflation and labor figures pour out. ""We're all living in a very precarious time going into this election, so, of course, that seems to dominate our thinking,"" she acknowledges. However, looking beyond the election noise, Miller points to the ongoing earnings season as relatively stable. ""It's all going to be about the economics because what we really want to know is will the Fed be continuing to lower rates into the end of the year and what does that pace look like,"" she tells Yahoo Finance. With this outlook, Miller highlights Equity Residential (EQR) as an investment opportunity. She notes it is ""the largest residential REIT,"" offering a 3.5% yield and positioned to benefit from lower interest rates. ""As home sales and home activity picks up, this is going to be a continued beneficiary. So I think this is an easy buy for a two to three-year hold,"" Miller states.
