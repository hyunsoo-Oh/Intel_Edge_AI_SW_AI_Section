""I think it's nothing sort of too far out of the ordinary,"" Ferguson says, noting that some drone activity, both recreational and ""a bit of surveillance,"" is typical. As drones make headlines, investors may wonder whether the tech could benefit aerospace and defense companies. The analyst says it will likely be smaller private tech companies and ""some of the bigger defense primes"" will gain from making technology to monitor drones. He names Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and RTX Corporation (RTX) (formerly Raytheon) as ""well-positioned with technologies like radars"" and ""technologies that intercept signals."" Ferguson notes that it's unlikely drone-related tech will ""move the needle"" for these defense companies, given they sell products like fighter jets at a $100 million price tag.

""I think most companies will be giving us a preview on their outlooks for 2025 and what the expectation is for top line growth there, as well as margins. And the thesis that I've had coming into this year is that the narrative that had dominated 2023 coming into the first half of 2024 — which was that growth was lagging and that margins were under pressure as companies absorbed higher costs driven by inflation and the pandemic and resulting in margin pressure — would shift to revenue growth is going to start accelerating and margins are going to expand,"" Gursky tells Yahoo Finance. Moving forward, he believes that investors should be focused on the labor productivity of these defense companies.

Dowlatshahi traces the evolution of DEI initiatives following the death of George Floyd in 2020, highlighting how companies initially took ""a strong stance supporting under-represented communities."" However, he points out the political and social climate has shifted since then, with ""the fall and the rise again of the Trump administration, conservative movement, and far-right movement in the United States, and the 'anti-woke' movements again. And because of that, you see now companies catering to those populations,"" pointing to businesses like Walmart and Lowe's (LOW). Despite these shifts, Dowlatshahi asserts that ""discrimination is still discrimination."" The attorney remains hopeful that established state and federal laws will continue to protect against workplace discrimination. Although, he acknowledges a concerning trend, telling Yahoo Finance ""I have seen an increase in fear, frankly."" ""The hope is that we can stand on state and federal law that has been in place for decades and decades,"" the MSD partner concludes.

The industrial sector has been showing strength, which Sakraida notes has largely been driven by easing interest rates. ""That 50 basis [point] cut really was a catalyst to drive this sector forward... last year, the sector was up 18%. This year it's up 20% year to date. So there's really high expectations looking really to 2025 as far as a recovery in sales and earnings growth and really a recovery in capital spending towards large capital goods like machinery,"" he tells Yahoo Finance. On the other hand, he notes that valuations have gone up and multiples have increased, which he calls a ""premium to the S&P 500 (^GSPC)."" With that backdrop, he advises, ""it really would be prudent for investors to be a bit more selective in this space and be a bit more discerning as far as where they're allocating their capital."" Sakraida has downgraded Deere from Hold to Sell, explaining that there is a continuation in the deterioration of fundamentals within agriculture and farm machinery: ""There has been record harvest yields across a number of different crops, and this has only helped to balloon supplies. Prices have suffered quite significantly."" While Deere has reiterated its profit guidance last quarter, he still believes there is ""high risk"" in the second half of 2024, and the company could end up cutting that guidance. He adds, ""And while lower interest rates are going to be a tailwind, they can't outperform those lower commodity prices. At the end of the day, farmer incomes are decreasing and that's going to hurt Deere and Co."" Sakraida has a Hold rating on Caterpillar, noting that the company will experience some favorable tailwinds, especially in its power generation business as the AI race continues to heat up. However, this is not the majority of the business, and most of its sales exist outside of the US where there are currently increased geopolitical risks.

Our clients don't need a Rolls-Royce. They want a luxury experience. And in China there's a growing community of ultra high net worth individuals. But of course, everyone knows there's been a lot of talk in the news about the luxury industry in China. You know, there are some there are some headwinds. But for us, we're very much invested in China. We see long-term potential there."" He adds, ""In fact, we've opened a private office in Shanghai, which is exactly the same as a private office that we have [in New York City], because increasingly, clients in China, they want a motorcar that reflects their personality...and in the first six months of opening the private office, we've had engagements with more than 200 clients there. So we see great potential in China in the future."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Wealth!

RLLCF,Rolls-Royce sees ‘rapid increase’ in personalized orders: CEO,"Rolls-Royce Motor Cars (RYCEY) CEO Chris Brownridge sits down with Brad Smith and Yahoo Finance’s senior auto reporter Pras Subramanian on Wealth! to discuss what the luxury car company’s clientele is looking for in their vehicles. Brownridge says, “What we're seeing in Rolls-Royce is a rapid increase in our clients asking for more and more bespoke motorcars. You know our whole business is all about creating unique pieces for our clients, and the demand for more specialized commissions is increasing quite significantly.” Brownridge is in New York for the opening of Rolls-Royce’s private office in the city. He says, “A lot of our clients when they understand what the possibilities are, it stimulates ideas for them. And that's the whole purpose of the private office. So they can spend time with our designers directly talking to them.” He adds, “We're seeing an increasing demand for commissions that have an emotional resonance for the particular client. So, in the past, the Rolls-Royce was perhaps a statement of wealth, and today, it's more of a statement of you as an individual. So we're seeing an increase in clients asking for aspects of the motorcar or the design of the car, which reflect their personality. It could be the color of their children's eyes, or it could be something incorporating mother of pearl from their own collection. But it's something very personal to them.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Wealth! This post was written by Naomi Buchanan.",Industrials

UPS CFO Brian Dykes joins Catalysts with Seana Smith and Josh Schafer to discuss the shift and what it means for the company and its collaboration with Amazon. ""One of the things that we announced was a strategic decision for us to start to glide down some of the volume from our largest customer over the course of the next six quarters,"" Dykes says, outlining that he views this move, along with other efficiency programs, as the company ""taking control of our own destiny."" The CFO says the decision enables the company to manage its assets and resources in order to ""drive higher yields and returns."" ""The result of this is that we will be taking volume down, and we'll have revenue down in 2025 and 2026, but it improves the margin in every quarter,"" he explains. He continues, ""We've had a 30-year relationship with Amazon ... with the amount of volume that we're talking about moving, it has to be an orderly transition, or else it would impact both their customers as well as our residual customers, and they will continue to be a customer of ours for the long term."" ""The portion of the business that we're transitioning out of just doesn't make sense for us to do ... from a competition standpoint, we actually still help Amazon with a lot of the things that make sense with our network, which is built for long zones, multiple pickup locations, and moving things across the country versus theirs, which is built for a much shorter fulfillment center to door network capability.""

Gursky explains the defense sector is doing well as governments look to bolster and modernize their defenses as ongoing geopolitical conflicts escalate: ""Military modernization is the way to deter our potential enemies, and that's what we're seeing today. We're seeing rising budgets and the modernization of a lot of military kit."" He provides one of his lesser known picks for the industry: ""TransDigm (TDG) is a bit more of a commercial aerospace company. They do provide quite a bit of parts that go into the defense industry, but I think most investors like that one because of its exposure to, the airline industry and by those that are buying new aircraft and, and servicing those aircraft. They have also been a serial acquirer rolling up a pretty fragmented industry."" Watch the video above to hear why Gursky also likes Ducommun (DCO).
