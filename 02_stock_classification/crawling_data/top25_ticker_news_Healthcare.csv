DHR,"3 investable themes, categories outside of the AI trade","While Nvidia's (NVDA) record high on Monday — the stock has since retreated in Tuesday trading — pushes the tech sector and hopes for the AI chip industry higher, perhaps there are still some opportunities for investors that lie outside of artificial intelligence. Alger Director of Market Strategy Brad Neuman sits down with the Catalysts team in-studio to talk about the three categories or investment themes he is seeing outside of AI: homebuilders, drug developers, and alternative asset managers. ""Structurally, we're short homes in America... maybe 2 million homes. So there's a supply-demand imbalance,"" Neuman tells Seana Smith. ""So it's an attractive market from that perspective. And cyclically mortgage rates are kind of elevated relative to the general interest rate picture."" In the homebuilder category, Neuman names Builders FirstSource (BLDR), NVR, Inc. (NVR), and Trex Company (TREX). Neuman also makes the case for structural-cyclical dynamics in the biotech and pharmaceutical space: ""The pipeline is growing, so it's a growth industry. That said there was an inventory overhang after COVID and the volumes have waned over the past couple of years. But we think they're on the upswing. And next year is setting up to be a normal year, or perhaps even better than that."" He names Repligen (RGEN) and Danaher (DHR) for this category. Lastly, Neuman turns to alternative asset management firms, and lists Blue Owl Capital (OWL), StepStone Group (STEP), and Hamilton Lane (HLNE) among potential opportunities.

In the aftermath of this event, Americans have expressed an outcry over their frustrations with dealing with health insurance providers and maneuvering the cracks in the US healthcare system. Center for Health and Democracy (CHD) President Wendell Potter joins Market Domination's Josh Lipton and Yahoo Finance senior health reporter Anjalee Khemlani to speak more about his self-described ""crisis of conscience"" when he worked within the health industry. Potter penned a New York Times op-ed piece last week titled&nbsp;I Was a Health Insurance Executive. What I Saw Made Me Quit. ""I became aware of the barriers that health insurance companies have put in place to assure their profitability, but that have resulted in more and more Americans not being able to get the care that they need, medically necessary care, even with insurance,"" the former Cigna (CI) vice president of communications explains. ""Those barriers that that they put in place to assure profitability and shareholder return really made me walk away. I used to handle financial communications for Cigna, my name was on all of the company's quarterly reports for ten years. So I saw how the company made money, where it came from, what they did with it, but also the way that they were able to earn the profits...""

ELV,Healthcare concerns rise as insurers deny patient claims,"Health insurance claim denials continue to be a significant challenge in the US healthcare system. When insurers reject claims, doctors and hospitals face delays in reimbursement for their services, often leading them to postpone patient care until procedures or treatments receive proper authorization. Recent Medicare data reveals that the industry average for denied claims has reached 17%, with UnitedHealthcare (UNH) showing the highest denial rate at 33%. Yahoo Finance Senior Health Reporter Anjalee Khemlani examines this issue, highlighting automation and artificial intelligence as one of the driving forces behind high denial rates. She discusses implications for healthcare providers and patients, and shares three tips to fight claim denials: 1) never pay the first bill, 2) fight with insurer for coverage, and 3) ask for cash pay options.&nbsp; To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth&nbsp;here.

CI,"How a Cigna, Humana merger could spark antitrust concerns","Healthcare industry giants Cigna (CI) and Humana (HUM) have reportedly rekindled merger talks, according to a recent Bloomberg report. Julie Utterback, Morningstar's senior equity analyst specializing in medical technology and services, joins Market Domination to provide insights on this potential industry-shaking development. Utterback emphasizes that the success of this partnership hinges on gaining approval from antitrust regulators, which she describes as ""a big if."" However, she notes the complementary nature of the two companies' strengths: Cigna is a powerhouse in the pharmacy benefit management (PBM) space, while Humana focuses more on government insurance plans. If the two were to join forces, they would be ""very complementary and have very little overlap,"" Utterback explains. Despite the potential synergies, Utterback highlights a key concern: Humana's position as the fourth-largest PBM could draw intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators. She warns that this merger ""could actually increase the concentration materially of the PBM industry."" Nevertheless, Utterback sees potential benefits for both companies. ""If they do go through with this merger deal, [Cigna] could be throwing a lifeline to Humana here in the near term,"" she states. She adds, ""We think in the long run, both of these companies have very good prospects in the next few years.""
